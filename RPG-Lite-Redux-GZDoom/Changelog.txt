RPGLite Redux.

Changes from the old RPGLite.

-even more streamlined and less broken than the old RPGLite
-Armor system entirely redone
-Spell system removed, felt kinda useless and out of place anyway
-Skills now replace the stat system entirely, remaining stats converted into skills.
-Unfortunately a lot of compatibility was lost, will need to work on patches for many mods.
-plus side is in compatibility patches i can add mod specific skills.
